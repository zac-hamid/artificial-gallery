# Artificial Gallery - An Unfinished Unity Game
A Unity game that accesses the Da-Vinci and DALL-E 2 API's to generate artworks in a gallery environment.

In Assets/Scripts/AIGenerator.cs you will need to put in your own DALL-E 2 API key and OpenAPI Org Id. 

Ideally the next steps for this project would be to tie it into Automatic1111's local version of Stable Diffusion to prevent the need for paying to use DALL-E 2's API, as well as expand the gallery to become procedural with possible "themes" for different areas.
